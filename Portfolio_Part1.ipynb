    "In particular, the data was collected through the MovieLens web site (movielens.umn.edu), which records a number of users' ratings (1-5) towards their watched movies. Besides, simple demographic info (e.g., age and gender) for the users and descriptive info (e.g., title and genre) for the movies are provided. \n",

    "Originally, there are several separate files to record the user-movie rating info, user demographic info and movie descriptive info, we have conducted preliminary processing to map and merge the data into one csv file named 'movielens_data.csv'. The header of the csv file is shown below. \n",
